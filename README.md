# The-Escapist-Portfolio
Code from my independent video game made in Godot 4, using GDScript (a variation of Python) and C#


**Solo Developer | Godot 4 | C# + GDScript**

## Key Feature
> Sync **3 characters across 3 identical worlds** in real time — shared position, shared abilities, auto-switch on input.

## Key Systems
| File | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `GDManager.gd` | Global shield: timer, collision, audio, sync logic |
| `GameManager.cs` | Central state manager (player/world index, death flags) |
| `player.gd` | State machine + scene inheritance for players 1, 2, and 3 |
| `AudioManager.gd` | Global Script that controls all audio output, including music and sound effects |
| `base_scene.gd` | Level class script; Life system, player 3's super-speed mechanics, world switching animations, game over screens, etc. |
